</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="well">

  <p>The echo test application example provides a complex test of the integrity of inter processor communication from linux userspace to a remote software context.</p>
  <p>The application sends chunks of data to the remote processor using <b>remoteproc</b>. The remote side echoes the data back to application which then validates the data returned.</p>
  <p>This application takes a few seconds to run, so be patient.  The complete results will be displayed below.</p>
  <p>The complete results will be displayed below after the echo test is finished.</p>

  <p>More information can be found in the latest <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2020_1/ug1186-zynq-openamp-gsg.pdf">UG1186</a> documentation (an internet connection is required to view this page).</p>
