</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="well">

  <p><strong>The Ultra96 WiFi must be configured and connected (have an IP address) on a wireless LAN (WLAN) to run this example.</strong></p>
  <p>The iperf3 application provides an easy way to test WiFi or Ethernet throughput.  The iperf3 application works in a client-server arrangement to examine how quickly TCP or UDP packets can be sent or received over a network.</p>
  <p>This example demonstrates the Ultra96 acting as an <b>iperf3 server</b> to receive TCP packets from an iperf3 client on the user's WLAN.  Running this example from the built-in
    browser on the Ultra96, with the the iperf3 client and server running on the same hardware and essentially operating in loopback mode, will produce invalid LAN throughput 
    results.  It is best to run this example from a networked device on the user's WLAN.</p>
  <p>The iperf3 application needs to be installed on the remote device.  Linux users can install this natively via the apt or yum package manager.  Mac and Windows users 
    can <a href="https://software.es.net/iperf/obtaining.html#binary-distributions">find binaries at ESnet</a> (an internet connection is required to view this page).</p>
<!--
  <p>The IP address of the Ultra96 is: <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">{{ request.host.split(':')[0] }}</span></p>
-->
  <p>The following command will run iperf3 as a client, connect to the Ultra96 at IP address <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">{{ request.host.split(':')[0] }}</span>, 
    update the speed calculation every 2 seconds, and stop after 20 seconds.  Click the <b>Run Project</b> button below and then enter the command below in a terminal window on the remote device:</p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">$ <span id="cmd">iperf3 -c {{ request.host.split(':')[0] }} -i 2 -t 20</span>  <a href="#" onclick="CopyToClipboard('cmd');return false;"><button id="copy">Copy Command</button></a></p>

  <p>The complete results will be displayed below after iperf3 is finished.</p>
  
  <p>More information on iperf3 can be found at <a href="https://software.es.net/iperf/index.html">ESnet</a> (an internet connection is required to view this page).</p>
