        <div class="well">
         <p>There are 4 GPIO LEDs on the Ultra96-V2 that can be controlled by the user and are located as shown in the image above. A user can control the LEDs through this webapp by changing what state they should be or what trigger they should be. The states are simply "On" and "Off" but the triggers are more confusing since they can provide more useful information to the user. The table of triggers and what they do is listed below. It is important to note that the triggers only turn "On"  when triggered and start in the "Off" state. </p>
